  <h1> Important JS and JQuery Terms</h1>
  <h2>NaN (not a number)
    <p>The NaN property represents "Not-a-Number" value. This property indicates that a value is not a legal number. The NaN property is the same as the Number.
    </p>
  </h2>

  <h2>Null
    <p>'Null' is a keyword in JavaScript that signifies 'no value' or nonexistence of any value. If you wish to shred a variable off its assigned value, you can simply assign 'null' to it. Besides this, like any other object, it is never implicitly assigned to a variable by JavaScript.</p> 
  </h2>

  <h2>Alert
    <p>
      A JavaScript alert is a simple window containing a message. 
    </p>
  </h2>

  <h2>Comments
    <p>
      The JavaScript comment feature simplifies the production of more readable code. They are easy to write and recognize: a JavaScript comment block (also known as the multi-line comment) begins with */ , while a single line comment starts with //.
    </p>
  </h2>

  <h2>JQuery
    <p>
      jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.
